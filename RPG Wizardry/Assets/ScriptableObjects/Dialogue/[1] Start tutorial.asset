  - Ahh.. home sweet home. Oh Willow, this is your first time in the tower right?
  - Let me teach you a bit about how this place works.
  - "I don\u2019t know if anyone gave you the memo, but this place is filled with
    many different monsters that probably love to have a taste of living meat."
  - So yes, you will probably be hunted down in here, BUT! I will personally make
    sure you get out of here before you actually will die.
  - "I\u2019d rather not die in here as well and I need a vessel to be able to cast
    magic."
  - "The only spell I\u2019ve retained is\u2026 bookerang\u2026 well, please try using
    it, but don\u2019t throw me too hard!"
