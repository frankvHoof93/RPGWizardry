  - Do you see that shiny purple stuff those slimes dropped? That's magic dust.
  - "If we want to use new magic spells, you\u2019ll need to gather enough magic dust
    so we can craft these spells."
  - But first we need to find a spell page, and I have a feeling we can get one in
    the next room.
